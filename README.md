# Socio-economic-factors-influencing-contributions-to-campaigns

This project examines the state-wise and year-wise contributions of the individuals to find the socio-economic factors that might explain the trends of contribution of the people of that state. The research question revolves around the influence that level of urbanization has on the total contributions from that state and also how the educational attainment of the population modulates this relationship. Furthermore, the effect of the overall economic status of the state on the contributions of the individuals from the states are also observed.

The base dataset sourced from the FEC of USA that consists of the contributor’s information and the committee’s details was preprocessed and cleaned to extract columns such as
contributor’s state and contribution amount to compile the state-wise total contribution of individuals for 2022. The American Community Survey datasets relating to the estimated figures of urban and rural population of each state was used to gauge the urbanized population percentage. The educational attainment dataset containing the age-wise level of education achieved by the people was used to determine the percentage of the population who are 18 years and over and have a Bachelor’s degree or higher qualification.
